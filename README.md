#Overview    
This project aims to analyze sentiment on Twitter related to various airlines using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. It helps you understand how the public perceives different airlines by classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
